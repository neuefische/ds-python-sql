    "In this notebook, we will show you how to use Fugue SQL to work with SQL in a python environment. Fugue SQL is a SQL engine that can run on Spark, Dask, Ray, and Pandas. It is a SQL engine that is designed for data scientists and engineers and to be easy to use.\n",
    "It also allows us to convert a Jupyter code cell into a SQL cell with the jupyter magic command ```%%fsql```.\n",
    "\n",
    "DuckDB is an in-process SQL OLAP database management system. The speed is very good on even gigabytes of data on local machines. Fugue has a deep integration with DuckDB. Fugue not only uses DuckDB as the SQL engine, but also implemented all execution engine methods using DuckDB SQL and relations. So in most part of the workflow, the data tables are kept in DuckDB and in rare cases the tables will be materialized and converted to arrow dataframes. Note this blog explains that converting between DuckDB and Arrow has minimal overhead.\n",
