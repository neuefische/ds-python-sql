    "# Introduction to Creating Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "To try out how to create tables and insert data into the tables we are using [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/) in this notebook. It is creating a local database which you can run SQL-queries in Jupyter Notebooks against. DBeaver also has a connector so you can also run SQL-queries in there. Duckdb works with [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) a widely used python library to connect to databases and ipython-sql. Ipython-sql allows us to convert a Jupyter code cell into a SQL cell with the jupyter magic command ```%%sql```.\n",
